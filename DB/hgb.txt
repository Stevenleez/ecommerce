Jadi Regular Awardees diminta langsung urus LA duluan (Hari itu juga dpt LoA)
3 Juli 2024
Bu Arida sedang nego dengan KVAC
Negotiations fail ~ harus pakai LoG
Good News ~ LoG akan diajukan ke kemdikbud

________________
Chapter Zero : Some QnA
Some Questions
1. Why is there no information regarding certain challenges?
Because each year might differ, we only document certain ones
2. Is it okay for me if my photos are not the same across documents?
It’s fine


________________
Chapter I : Passport
Chapter I Part I : Passport
Passport, Pass. Port.


Assuming the IISMA announcement is the 3rd week of March.
Have it by 31st of April (if you are regulate awardees), assuming deadline is 31st of May (Deadline of HYU 2024 is 31st of May), You must have your passport before the deadline of submission (HYU Cofund 2024 deadline is 14 June)
When submitting, submit the first 5 pages, if the 4th/5th page is blank, still submit that (this is so IISMA can definitely know for sure if you have an endorsement page or not)


Passport is not for visa only but for registration in Hanyang’s system, miss that and you’re toast.
Make sure the passport still works 6 months after the study period. Make sure to extend if the passport does not fulfill the 6 month rule above. Use Insider (Ordal) if needed.
  

The box mentioned in the passport form is the box above
________________


Chapter I Part II : Names
Names


Names must be uniform on all documents (KK, KTP, Passport, Akta Kelahiran)
IF THERE ARE ANY ISSUES CONTACT SR FIRST


The following are examples : 


Example 1 (Safe) :  Edric Boby Tri Raharjo
* KTP : Ardian Bethany Cassidian
* Passport : Ardian Bethany Cassidian


Example 2 (Safe) : 
* KTP : Mike Mo Manny
* Passport : Mike Mo M
   * Endorsement : Mike Mo Manny


Example 3a (Ask SR)
* KTP : M. Agus Budiman
* Passport : Muhammad Agus Budiman


Example 3b (Ask SR)
* KTP : Charles P. Ilya D.
* Passport : Charles Prageritz Ilya Domscovitch


Solution (3a + 3b) : Ask SR First, sometimes in the case of abbreviated names in KTP, it won’t be an issue


Example 4 (Unsafe)
* KTP : Rio Sanchez De’ardia
* Passport : Rio Sanchez Deardia


Solution : Change KTP (Yes, that single apostrophe (‘) is an issue)


Example 5 (Unsafe)
* KTP : S. Michael 
* Passport : S Michael


Solution : Change KTP (Yes, that single dot (.) is an issue)
Reason why it is bad : The dot may indicate that your name is not just an S


Example 6 (Unsafe)
* KTP : Bertha Maydia Cyclottus
* KK : Bertha Maydia Cyclottus Diadonia
* Passport : Bertha Maydia Cyclottus


Solution : Change KTP and create endorsement letter for passport 


Example 7 (Unsafe)
* KTP : Chancey Miles Kilometero
* KK : Chancey Miles Kilometero
* Passport :  Chancey Miles 


Solution : Make endorsement letter for passport 




Example 8 (Unsafe)
* KTP : Kim Hoo Jin
* KK : Kim Hoo Jin
* Passport :  Kim Hoo Jeen


Solution : Make endorsement letter for passport for other name/alias OR change name
________________
Chapter II : Courses
Courses


Courses are the wildest variables, meaning this rule might not apply to the next batch of awardees


However you are encouraged to choose 4 main courses (4 courses only, minimum 4, max 4, no more no less) and 4 backup courses. Why is that? Just in case you lost the KRS war or the scheduled conflict. You are not allowed to join online courses.


There is an option to join the Korean Language Course, it is free, but it is not counted as 1 of the 4 courses mentioned above, check your email for registration.
Can I join after choosing 4 courses above? Yes
Can I not join? Yes
Do I need to pay for the KR Language Course? No
Can I choose 3 main courses and 1 Korean Language Course? No


You are only allowed to change if and only if you lost the war, class is full or schedules conflict, or your home uni is not able to convert the credits with your current courses, but other courses would suffice for them


________________


The procedure to changing course is 
* Tell SR about it, what you changed, and most importantly WHY?
* Tell your home uni to make new recommendation letter containing the new set of courses The point is, the new recommendation letter is to state that the new courses will be given recognition/conversion to new SKS
*     

Kak Aswan
   * Submit that letter to IISMA (Through SR), SR will submit to Kak Aswan


Direct Quote from Bu Arida 2024
“Ganti course hanya bisa apabila
1. Course awal yg dipilih di batalkan oleh host uni/kelas penuh
2. ⁠awardee pilih course lain dalam list terbaru yg diberikan oleh host uni dengan konsultasi ke home uni. Setelah konsultasi dan mendapatkan persetujuan dari home uni, updated course list dimintakan approval ke PIC Kawasan.
3. ⁠setelah proses registrasi di host uni selesai, awardees mengurus revisi surat rekomendasi dari home uni yang berisi updated course list sesuai hasil registrasi di host uni dan mengumpulkan surat tersebut ke penunjang kawasan”


the KRS war is a “first come, first served” basis where people compete for a class where students press “apply for class” button to get the class, it is subject to constraints such as “no class can be applied for more than X students” (Where X is a predetermined number)


However, we are visiting students and the exclusive courses for us will be relatively easy to grab since the visiting students will take the course registration first and seats left will be open to other exchange students afterwards.


Nanodegree : 
Nanodegree is a bonus certificate that you get after completing the 2 courses that are under that nanodegree
So a nanodegree isn’t really a course, it’s just a bonus certificate
If you want to change your courses solely and only to obtain a nanodegree, it is prohibited!


Lose War -> Alternative Solution
  
If the class is full:
   * Email the professor to inquire about adding a seat. Their email address can be found in the course description.
   * Be sure to CC region1@iisma.id and jia720@hanyang.ac.kr on your email. (Forget this and I will personally marahin you 😁)
   * BE RESPECTFUL WITH LANGUAGE AND REMEMBER OFFICE HOURS (8AM - 5.30PM KST)[d]
   * Apparently this is not allowed

< OUTDATED LIST >
  

< UPDATED LIST [PAGE 16, 20] >
  

 2024-2 Course Registration Guidebook(Visiting Program).pdf (dropbox.com)
2024 Arahan IISMA : 
If the course you originally have chosen is not here, find 4 courses in the exclusive list, ask your KUI/Kaprodi/whoever is in charge for recommendation letter with the updated courses (The letter format is the same as the one you used to register for IISMA with the seal and signature, The signature must be from your head of study program or someone of a higher level of authority - this means your head of OIA is out of the answer)
Newest Update : The list has been updated in a recent email

Q : How many max nanodegree?

Q : How to lookup the course?

Course Registration (hanyang.ac.kr)


________________


How to check syllabus
   1. Search Course Code [Course Registration (hanyang.ac.kr)]
  

   2. Press the number here
  

(Step 3 is next page)
________________
   3. Press either one of the pointed areas or just scroll down
  



Q : I see that some of my courses I’ve chosen are not found in the list
A : welp. 😢 choose a new one or consult your head of study program for choosing the course which are more likely to get converted to Indo-SKS* (please choose from the Exclusive Course list)


*Policy per home uni might change


Q : Will there be a separate course registration period for us visiting students?
Or will we be competing with the degree students?
A : → We do have a separate day of course registration for the exchange/visiting students, but on that day only some seats of the English courses are initially open to the exchange/visiting students and the number is relatively small. As I have mentioned, the course registration is basically a first come first serve basis, and very competitive, so we highly recommend the students to check the T/O of courses in advance, and prepare plan B for their course registration. 


+ But the exclusive courses for visiting students program will be relatively easy to grab since the visiting students will take the course registration first and seats left will be open to other exchange students afterwards.


Q : I heard that the application date for nanodegree is before the course registration. May I ask what date we will be able to register for it? 
A : → We are planning to send you the newsletter regarding the nanodegree like last year! Plus, there would also be a newsletter regarding the course registration around one month before the beginning of the semester(one~two weeks before the course registration), so do not worry much about the specific details related to course registration/change procedure. 


But to tell you briefly at this moment, we will have the application for nanodegree in advance, where we will receive the google survey from students. Accordingly, we will enroll the courses automatically before the course registration period, and you can grab other courses during the course registration period. To check the courses and tracks of the nanodegrees, please refer to our website (https://exchangein.hanyang.ac.kr/visiting). We are planning to open 6 tracks from this upcoming fall, but the newly made two tracks (society and technology 7 korean aesthetics and culture) will be open to students from University of Texas first and will be open to other students if there are seats available. 


→ Even though a student missed to apply for the nanodegree track within a period, if they did the course registration at the very last moment, we will see the transcripts of the students at the end of the semester and issue a nanodegree & certificate just like other students, so do not worry much!


→ But the most important thing is to register/drop the courses within designated time. Sometimes students come to our office saying that they would like to register/drop courses after the course registration period ends, but we cannot help the students at all. So please read the newsletter thoroughly when they are sent!

Chapter III : Apostille
Apostille Affairs


You will need to provide 2 documents : 
   * Certificate of Enrollment (alias : SKMA/CoE/Surat Keterangan Mahasiswa Aktif) : No structured format - the format depends on your own Uni. TTD SKMA could be in digital form (digital signature), it’s okay!


If your home uni is making it way too hard to obtain this, CONTACT SR 


Certificate of Enrollment  Enrollment Letter
   * Ijazah SMA : You can use ijazah SMA or anything that states you have passed High school (again, no fixed formats)
If Ijazah SMA make sure that there are 2 pages, 1 page with your face and stamp, the other are your grades’


recommended translators : 
  



You will need to follow 2 commands :
   * Translate to english by a sworn translator (this is useless if the document is already in english)


if SKMA is already english no need to sworn translate 
        
if you want to use the agent’s translation service, submit 2-3 days earlier (pay attention to each year’s SR policy made on this)


   * Get it stamped with an apostille (takes 7*** days, only need softcopy)


Surat Kuasa : 
   * Link to template : Folder Template (There’s a FAQ and instructions there too)
Frequently asked questions surat kuasa : 
Q: Kak, kalau jadi 2 halaman aman kan? 
A: AMAN!


*** : Due to the rising surge of applicants (other KR host uni also use Amel) can be later than 7 days


Applying for legalization of documents is recommended to be done together, PAYMENT IS DONE THROUGH THE TREASURER 
  
[e]
  



At some point, you will need to sign surat kuasa : 
   * Follow the commands issued by Kak Amel


What if my real document for high school graduation is lost/no other documents to prove your graduation?
   * Have a softcopy? print. that. instead.
   * Completely lost? contact your school, ASAP
________________


Chapter IV : MCU + TBC         
Medical Check Up
What tests are needed? 
UNDER ALL CONDITIONS ONLY GIVE ATTENTION TO : 
   * OFFICIAL D-2-8 NEEDS
   * IISMA’S INQUIRY 
   * HOST UNI REQUIREMENTS
So in light of this, TBC only*, no syphilis/STD
Pay attention if the hospital is already officiated and the format for the document (see D28 link below)
(*again, check all above)


MCU dan TBC adalah 2 tes berbeda, yang 1


Higher ups’ decree :
Idealnya waktu berangkat sertif MCU/TBC nya masih berlaku, dan jangan terlalu mepet, supaya misal kalau ada masalah bisa treatment, jgn sampe tes nya mepet lalu ternyata pas tes ada masalah lalu gagal berangkat


List of hospitals :

Chapter V : International Insurance
International Insurance


You will need 2 insurances, 1 in Korea (NHIS Insurance) (you’ll deal when you arrive, do not fuss about this first in earlier dates), 1 in Indonesia (you will need to take care of this) 


For Regular Awardees : 
   * IISMA will pay for the NHIS insurance, you only need to pay for the Indonesia
For Cofund Awardees : 
   * You will need to pay both the NHIS insurance and Indonesia Insurance


Here’s some info
       
some agents for int insurance number
This travel insurance will be needed to sign up in HYU portal, refer to chapter XIV


Due to the nature of secrecy of the nomor polis, HYU 24 council has decided diurus sendiri sendiri


Statements from HYU : 


  

Guideline : should
1) Indicate the applicant as a beneficiary,
2) Be valid during the entire study abroad period at Hanyang
3) Cover International travel and medical expenses in Korea including the phrase that the policy is valid for international travel (worldwide, Asia, abroad, international, etc)
4) Be in English


* If you have submitted other documents well only except the insurance document, we will process the application without the insurancy policy for now.
But we will send the relevant students to upload/update it until 1 month before the beginning of the semester, and at that time the application system will be closed,
so if any student receive the email, you can submit the document by replying to our email.
  

I reviewed whether this document would also be appropriate, and since it states 'Silver B can be used in Asia', we will accept the document as well.
But since the coverage may differ from international travel insurance, we would highly recommend students to check/sign up for international insurance just in case one may visit hospital in Korea.
Note : 
Fixed dates for 2024 : 
29 Agu DEPART — 24 December GO BACK[f]

Chapter VI : Shipping Docs
Shipping Docs to Korea


If you read the newsletter, then you’ll find that we have to ship the hard file of our documents to Hanyang directly. Soooooo here we go!


HYU 2024 Awardees : 
Due to a logistic issue, Hanyang has given us a deadline extension but ONLY for the shipping of our hardfile (sorry no extension for the portal itself). Thus, we’ll collectively send our documents to Hanyang using a courier, EMS to be exact.


What needs to be sent to Hanyang:
   * Ijazah SMA translated version (the one that’s already been apostilled)
   * Ijazah SMA original version (the one in bahasa)
   * SKMA translated version (the one that’s already been apostilled)
   * SKMA in bahasa (if any)
   * Financial Affidavit


Documents you need to submit by pc
Since your Co-SR will be handling the shipment, please send these documents to her (Callista) via Whatsapp:
   * Ijazah SMA original version (the one in bahasa) (only if you didn’t use amel’s translation service. because if you do, i still got your ijazah indo files)
   * SKMA in bahasa (if any)
   * Financial Affidavit
note for financial affidavit: please do not attach the nomination letter on your financial affidavit file that you’ll be sending to your Co-SR (as for the portal itself, please refer it to the next chapter)
Why don't you need to attach the nomination letter?
Because i’ll be printing all the financial affidavits and it’d be redundant to print the nomination letter again and again just because all of us attached it on each of our documents. Only one hard copy of nomination letter is needed


NAME FORMAT (so sorry for using capslock)
PLEASE RENAME ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS WITH YOUR FULL NAME, JUST YOUR FULL NAME (no need to add anything, no need to rename it with “financial affidavit_Callista”)
Example: Callista Christhabella Emmanuelle.pdf
also all the format is in PDF


DEADLINE: 10 JUNE


Shipment will be done collectively so no one should ship on their own. If you had submitted all your documents needed to your Co-SR just relax and wait for further updates!


Shipping price: TBA but IISMA does not pay for this
Payment scheme for shipping: will be announced by the treasurers

________________


Bank Account Balance Certificate Instructions:
   1. Currency Requirements: The certificate should ideally display balances in both USD and IDR. If the issuing bank cannot provide balances in USD, IDR alone is acceptable (Hanyang Staff will handle the conversion to IDR).
   2. Addressing: The certificate must be addressed to Hanyang. While it is not required to use the full Hanyang KUI address, "Hanyang" must be included somewhere in the "To:" section.

   * The identity of the sponsor

Chapter VIII : Bank
Bank


HYU 2024 Regular Awardees : 
Rekening Bank Mandiri  Edric Boby Tri Raharjo
Awardees perlu segera membuat rekening mandiri baru yang nama rekening 100% sama dengan nama pada KTP. Hal ini untuk mempermudah proses verifikasi buku rekening dan mempercepat proses pencairan dana. Dalam waktu dekat IISMA yang telah bekerjasama dengan pihak Bank Mandiri akan melakukan sosialisasi kepada seluruh awardees IISMA 2024 terkait penggunaan rekening, kartu, dan livin mandiri di luar negeri. Terimakasih.


Follow commands, this one is not a fixed variable. In general, IISMA does not know about the technicalities, ask the bank instead (there’s usually a PIC for it from the bank)


________________


Chapter IX : Losing Awardee
How (not) to lose your status as an awardee
   * Be hostile towards other awardees, commit BBB (Bully, Beatdown, Break)
   * Do not attend Pre Departure sessions whatsoever with no valid reason and a permit issued by your KUI (Look at Chapter XV)
   * Falsely declare your document status/readiness
   * Flaunt activites/status excessively




________________


Chapter X : SKCK
SKCK
Important Notes on Submitting SKCK
   * Ensure your SKCK (Police Clearance Certificate) is still valid at the time of submission. It is recommended that the certificate remains valid for at least 2-3 months after submission.
   * The purpose of the SKCK is simply to demonstrate that you have no criminal record. The specific reason for your application is not critical. To avoid complications, use straightforward reasons like “Apply for Scholarship” or “Receive an award” when speaking to the officer in charge.
   * Any valid reason for obtaining an SKCK is acceptable, such as:
   * Applying for a job
   * Receiving an award
   * (Avoid using reasons like adopting a child unless necessary)
Make the process easier by choosing simple, general reasons and avoiding unnecessary details.
   *

Chapter XI : Wrong Submit
“Menunggu Verifikasi” + Wrongly submitted documents
  

        As of 29 May 2024, please be patient, we do not know when they will be verified, so please be patient. If you have wrongly submitted or if you changed name, you can wait until you are rejected (Contact SR!), to resubmit.
2024 Awardees can access the mistake list in the WA group  
bit.ly/HYUWRONGDOCS 
Usually when it’s close to the Yudisium date, you can start dealing with this (as an SR) and ask the higher ups to reject the submitted docs to be resubmitted.

Year you will become at Hanyang = 3 -  if you are 4th Semester
Year you will become at Hanyang = 4 -  if you are 6th Semester
But this doesn’t really matter
“Regarding the year coming to Hanyang, the official transcript does not specify the grade that you come to Hanyang University, but just indicates the Name, Gender, Date of Birth, Student Number, Date of Admission, Department, Course/Grade List.”
   4. Mailing Address
  

Use Indonesian Address 
Phone number you can split to 3 e.g. 62 (88XX - XXXX - XXX), you can combine to 1, doesn’t matter,  important thing is use 62 (8XXXX)

Chapter XV : IISMA PS + Challenge
Pre Departure Series, Challenge, and Permit Procedures


*Might differ year to year
For SR : Please keep track of the absence of awardees and store them (Name and what session they missed) this will prove to be useful during Yudisium
Permit to be absent :
For ALL IISMA Awardees:
   * Advance Notification:
   * Contact your SR at least 24 hours in advance if you have other commitments during the IISMA PS.
   * The SR will seek approval from the IISMA team to determine if your reason is valid (class and tests are usually accepted).
   * Do not forget to ask KUI for a letter of explanation. (No template, but an example below is provided)
   * Invalid Excuses:
   * Organization-related activities, panitia duties, and competitions are not considered valid excuses.
   * Only Force Majeure or sudden, unavoidable circumstances may be considered, but approval is not guaranteed as the decision lies with IISMA, not your SR.
   * Partial Attendance:
   * If the PS is scheduled from 9 AM to 2 PM and your commitment is from 7 AM to 11 AM, you are required to join the PS from 11 AM to 2 PM.
   * You must participate as much as possible.
   * Extra Tasks:
   * You will be given extra tasks if you miss any session.
   * Absence Procedure:
   * If you fail to attend, you must submit a SS gagal absenya (IMPORTANT) and contact your SR for the form to appeal your absence.
   * Consequences of Multiple Absences:
   * Missing 3 PS sessions will result in the termination of your status as an awardee.
These rules are decreed by IISMA and must be followed strictly.
Example of letter
  



IISMA PS-E :
Harus diikuti kalau tidak hadir/izin IISMA PS. Surat izin ditulis oleh jurusan dan ditujukan je Pak Rachmat, jika tidak bisa ditulis oleh jurusan, boleh dari KUI. Isi perizinan disesuaikan.


Form Banding Kehadiran IISMA PS (2024)


Berikut kebijakan dari program:
1. Seluruh complain harus menyertakan bukti yang menyatakan komplain tersebut, contoh presensi gagal sertakan SS presensi gagal, berlaku untuk post test juga .
2. ⁠Segala bentuk komplain akan di cross check dengan data kehadiran dan submission post test dari program.


Seluruh bukti yang hanya menyertakan ss zoom tidak diterima ya. Sesuai dengan yang berkali-kali di remind di zoom webinar.


Link banding khusus region 1,2 dan 6.
Banding : https://forms.gle/LHk8wyiKiVgAXdFfA   
Chapter XVI : Track Verif from HYU
HYU will send an email containing a spreadsheet for softfile and hardfile verification, they will state if a problem exists there


Please revise your documents as fast as possible ~ failing to do so might make Hanyang mail the region higher ups to revise the documents like this
  

Chapter XVII : Yudisium
Yudisium
What is Yudisium? 
The Yudisium is a critical event where awardees take responsibility for their actions during the IISMA program and ensure all necessary preparations are completed. 
Who attends it?
The following participants are required to attend the Yudisium:
   * Awardees: All regular/cofund awardees must be present.
   * OIA Representatives: A representative from the home university's Office of International Affairs (OIA) must accompany each awardee.
If any 1 of the mentioned above is unable to attend, both are not permitted to join zoom
Cofund awardees cannot attend Regular awardees’ Yudisium and vice versa
Consequence(s) for failing to be present
Failing to attend the Yudisium will have severe repercussions:
   * Delayed Financial Support (REGULAR AWARDEES) : If either you or your OIA representative fails to attend, the Settlement and Living Allowance for the entire cohort will be delayed indefinitely.
   * Risk to Award Status: Your status as an awardee is at risk. Absence from this event triggers a lengthy and complex resolution process.
Example : a person named Dondi Mithateme missed yudisium because he forgot, now he is faced with a choice
   * Forfeit the awardee status (This means not going to IISMA)
   * Ask a letter from KUI saying “I will be committed not to messing up again” and etc. (SO MUCH)
   * Rescheduling: The Yudisium will be rescheduled to an unknown date, causing further delays and complications for all involved.
Your cooperation and timely attendance are crucial to avoid these severe repercussions. Ensure both you and your OIA representative are present at the Yudisium to maintain your award status and receive the necessary financial support.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
QnA
   1. One of the awardees has a very important thing that cannot be delayed during that time, what do I do?
If it really is something very urgent or Force Majeure , You will need to reschedule Yudisium
SR - Read This
“8. SR diharapkan dapat mempresentasikan progres persiapan keberangkatan dari teman-teman dalam satu Host University (maksimal 5 menit), meliputi:

Chapter XVIII Part 3 : History
Some History and Experience
Please, continue this tradition, SRs of 2025, 2026, 2027, and so on
Regarding Letter of Guarantee (LoG)
2023 : Use NomLet Individual as LoG and accepted
2024 : (Read Chapter Zero : Extras)
"Harus diterbitkan dari Universitas Korea atau apabila dari IISMA, mohon melampirkan dengan kop surat dari Kementerian." - KVAC
Therefore as of 5th of July we have no choice but to wait for Letter of Guarantee from KEMDIKBUD
However, Hanyang Vokasi (ERICA Campus) have been successful in applying for visas by using NomLet individu and Invitation Letter as the LoG
Then SR of 2024 used his mom’s phone to ask KVAC again, and it was granted to use Nomination Letter Individual as Letter of Guarantee
So in the end HYU 2024, just like 2023 used Nomination Letter
Regarding Documents
2024 : 
Kita datang bersama sama di 17 Juli, 20++ orang
Ada beberapa yang hanya diminta NomLet Individu, ada yang diminta transkrip nilai, ada yang diminta NomLet keseluruhan, ada yang diminta Letter of Acceptance dan NomLet Individu
(Intinya kita datang bersama dan dicek di waktu yang sama pun, permintaan dokumen varies)

Some General Info
Later in Korea, regular awardees should continue to actively use their bank account so that the second living allowance can be transferred and the account doesn't become dormant.


If both the settlement allowance (SA) and location allowance (LA) haven't been disbursed, we won't go to Korea (Delay flight, you will miss some stuff).


We need either the settlement allowance (SA) or location allowance (LA), at least one of them, to pay the dormitory deposit.
  



Now regarding names - NAMA ACCOUNT BANK HARUS SAMA PERSIS SEPERTI NAMA (LIHAT GAMBAR DI ATAS)
Untuk mengantisipasi beda, bisa dari awal dipastikan sama, namun tidak tertutup kemungkinan bahwa ada yang namanya panjang
      1. Tanyakan ke Koor Wilayah (2024 : Kak Aswan) Bagaimana enaknya, biasanya akan di tanyakan oleh Koor ke tim keuangan (SELALU KONSULTASIKAN TERLEBIH DAHULU!)
Namun ada beberapa contoh yang disamarkan nama aslinya, jadi harus dijelaskan di Narasi
Kasus 1 : Nama di profile berbeda dan tidak bisa diubah, Tambahkan berikut di narasi
Tambahkan berikut di narasi
Nama awardee yang tercantum pada portal IISMA pada bagian personal info (bank account) : Yvonne Artaxya Trivivita Norbette
nama awardee setelah dibenarkan : Yvonne Artaxya Trivivita (Norbette)
nama awardee yang tercantum pada bank mandiri : Yvonne Artaxya Trivivita
Kasus 2 : Nama di portal profile typo agak parahdan tidak bisa diubah, Tambahkan berikut di narasi
KTP : Pichyttia Eichelheissen Marrianne
nama bank di personal profile IISMA : Pichyttia Eichelheis
Nama Rekening : Pichyttia Eichelheissen Marrianne
Tambahkan berikut di narasi
**ada typo di data Akun Bank di portal IISMA, Nama Pemilik Rekening seharusnya Pichyttia Eichelheissen Marrianne
Kasus 3 : Nama awardee panjang sehingga nama di profile portal IISMA terpotong dan nama di rekening bank juga terpotong (namun di kasus ini ybs sudah bertanya ke pihak mandiri dan dibilang aman aman saja)
Diketahui juga 
Actual Long Name in Real Life : Masami Riku Chiaki Koji Hasegawa
Nama : M Riku Chiaki K Hasegawa
Nama Account : M RIKU CHIAKIK HASE
Nama di profile portal IISMA : M RIKU CHIAKIK HASEGAWA
Setelah berkonsultasi tidak usah ditambahkan apapun di narasi, biarkan nama account dan nama sesuai dengan yang ada

Bonus Chapter II : Merch
Some QnA Regarding Merch
Q: Merch Logo Usage Confirmation: May we use the lion logo for our merchandise? (Details below)


Details regarding the Logo 
  

We would like to inquire about the possibility of using the lion logo and related text on merchandise, specifically on the sleeves. We understand the importance of obtaining proper authorization and want to clarify our intentions.


We do not intend for this merchandise to be perceived as "official" merchandise. While the lion logo and text will be featured on the sleeves, the inclusion of "IISMA 2024" on the other side should differentiate it from any official products.


To avoid any potential misunderstandings, we kindly request your confirmation regarding our permission to proceed with this design.

“As long as you are not selling them for profit, you may design and produce t-shirts for your own use.
Are the students designing the t-shirts themselves? The designs look so cute that I would like to wear one too ;) !” - Ms. JeeAh
